Simulate the card aging power up on Trello boards.

The aging is applied in 3 states, at 7, 14, or 28 days without any action in the card. 

Important reminder: In the official power up, the card aging is removed if someone just change the card position (drag and drop) inside a list. This extension considers the last activity of the card, what might be a comment, atacchment, anything who left a log inside the card.


To-do:
- [ ] Choose which date the aging effect will be based on.
- [ ] Choose which boards should be ignored.
- [ ] Choose the position of the labels.
- [ ] Define formats for the displayed information.
- [ ] Define custom time ranges for the aging effects.
