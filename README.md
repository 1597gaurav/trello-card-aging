Provide some features related with the card age and activity.

## Aging effect
The aging effect is the same as the one provided from the Card Aging power-up, except for one detail:
In the official power up, the card aging is removed if someone just change the card position (drag and drop) inside a list. This extension considers the last activity of the card, what might be a comment, atacchment, anything who left a log inside the card.

## Last activity
Creates an indicator at the bottom of the card, that shows the time difference between now and the last activity of the card.

## Card age
Creates an indicator at the bottom of the card, that shows the time difference between now and the card creation.
